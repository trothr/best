# Git and GitHub

This page discusses Git and GitHub.

Git is a source code control system not unlike CVS, Subversion,
and others. Git tracks changes and (for textual files) can report
line-by-line differences from one revision to the next. It is
usually used for coordinating work among programmers, which is
its origin: to maintain the Linux kernel source code.

Some of this content is taken from the wikipedia page for Git.

## Git

Git was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, author of the Linux kernel.

Each copy of a specific Git project is a complete stand-alone repository.
Each copy can work independently of others and of the server or
central/master repository.

Git has become, according to some reports, the most popular distributed
version control system. It is free software and is standard with systems
like Linux.

Git is well integrated into some of the more popular IDEs,
notably Eclipse and Visual Studio.

Git is the utility, the client program.
GitHub is one of several Git servers.

## GitHub

There are many popular services supporting Git including GitHub
and GitLab. This particular page is hosted by GitHub.

GitHub was acquired by Microsoft in 2018.
Some users were skeptical and fled to other providers like GitLab.
But Microsoft has proven to be a good steward of the service
even adding Git functionality to some of their software products.
