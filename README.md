# best

This project is a collection of best-practice guides.

## Best, not Only

When we say "best practice" we don't mean there is only one way to
proceed. We simply mean that there are ways which are recognized as
better than other ways for a variety of reasons.

In some situations, places, and disciplines,
there really is only one right way. We're not talking about that here.

## Learn to Type

If you don't know how to type, consider taking a class.

Becoming a "touch typist" will make most computer interaction
a lot easier which will make everything you do, especially in this
collection of guides, more pleasant and more effective.

Many excellent typists are self-taught.
But if there is any question about your typing skill,
money spent on a formal course would be well spent. Do it!

In any case, learn to type. You will be glad that you did.

## Document Your Code

Most of what is discussed here relates to program development, "coding"
(and not in the medical sense). Coding is fun, and what you code
should be obvious to you. But it will likely *not* be obvious to others.

Someone else will come along after you and pick-up where you left-off.
For their sake, leave clear explanations. All programming languages
discussed here have a concept "commenting". USE IT. Comment your code.

You will hopefully find one (or several!) project which is such a
labor of love that you never want to give it up. But plan to give it up.
You will not live forever. Even if you outlive your code, you will very
likely reach a point where you don't want to maintain any given project.
Prepare ahead of time for that hand-off. Comment your code.

True story: <br/>
One especially brilliant software developer was reviewing some code.
There was a particularly tricky statement. As he tried to wrap his head
around what this statement was supposed to achieve, he read the comment:
"If you don't understand this, you should not be reading my code!". 

It was his own code.

Don't make that mistake. <br/>
Comment well. Comment in plain human language.
